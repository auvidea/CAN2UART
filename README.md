  Current features
  - canmode 0:
    Loopback mode 
    Sends received messages from can back to sender in reverted letters
    e.g:
    ID: 123 DLC: 8 DATA: aa bb cc dd ee ff 00 11 99
    ID: 123 DLC: 8 DATA: 99 11 00 ff ee dd cc bb aa
    (this is a simplyfied output, yours may differ from what you use as a interpreter)
    
 - canmode 1:
    Normal mode
    Sends messages from UART to CAN
    
 - LED default mode: flashing LED

 Planned features

  /src/

  ../main: main part of can2uart software 

  ../can: used for transmitting messages over can

  ../i2c: handle i2c messages 

  ../rcc: handles system messages

  ../usart: same as can but for uart
