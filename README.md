  **Current features** <br />
  - canmode 0: <br />
    Loopback mode (only for test purposes) <br />
    Sends received messages from can back to sender in reverted letters <br />
    e.g: <br />
    ID: 123 DLC: 8 DATA: aa bb cc dd ee ff 00 11 99 <br />
    ID: 123 DLC: 8 DATA: 99 11 00 ff ee dd cc bb aa <br />
    (this is a simplyfied output, yours may differ from what you use as a interpreter) <br />
    
 - canmode 1: <br />
    Normal mode <br />
    Sends messages from UART to CAN or CAN to CAN<br />
    
 - LED default mode: flashing LED <br />
